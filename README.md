# KeyAuth Documentation

KeyAuth documentation has moved to [https://KeyAuth.readme.io ](https://keyauth.readme.io). We have made it easier for you to make requests from the site and not need to implement it into your project to test it out. We hope you enjoy!

For now, this site will be used to explain the features on the dashboard of [https://keyauth.cc](https://keyauth.cc) . This may be moved to the new documentation page eventually, but for now it will remain here.\
