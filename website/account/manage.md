# Manage

{% hint style="info" %}
This is used in order to protect your seller key if you have one. Do NOT share your seller key with anyone. Instead, create a manager or a reseller account.
{% endhint %}

## Creating A Reseller

A reseller will be able to create as many keys as their balance allows. The balance can be given manually by you by editing the account after you have made it or your resellers can purchase an additional balance. Here is everything that you will need in order to create a reseller:&#x20;

* Account Application - Select the application you would like the reseller to have access to,
* Account Username - Set a username for the reseller,&#x20;
* Account Email - Set an email for the reseller,&#x20;
* Account Password - Set a password for the reseller,&#x20;
* Allowed license level(s) - Set the level(s) the reseller can distribute. Make sure you use the format (1|2|3|)

## Creating A Manager

A manager is locked to the application that you assign them to and can do just about everything except rename, pause, refresh secret, and delete the application. They also can not see the owner ID of the application. Here is everything that you will need in order to create a manager:



* Account Application - Select the application you would like the reseller to have access to,
* Account Username - Set a username for the reseller,&#x20;
* Account Email - Set an email for the reseller,&#x20;
* Account Password - Set a password for the reseller,&#x20;
* Allowed license level(s) - Set the level(s) the reseller can distribute. Make sure you use the format (1|2|3|)

Unlike creating a reseller, you can enable or disable the pages the manager can see. This will be at the bottom of the panel once you start the process of creating a manager.&#x20;
