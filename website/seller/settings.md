Sharing your seller key with anyone will result in a permanent ban of your KeyAuth account!
{% endhint %}

## What is the seller link?

The seller link can be used for Shoppy or Sellix dynamic product type to automatically send license(s) to your users so that you never need to restock or create more if requested.&#x20;

## What is the discord bot?

If you choose to add the KeyAuth discord bot to your server you will be able to manage your licenses and other options just like you normally would from the KeyAuth dashboard.
